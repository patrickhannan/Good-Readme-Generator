## Installation

The user must download the files from this repository. Those can be accessed [here](https://github.com/patrickhannan/Good-Readme-Generator).

Once the user downloads these files, they must open the files in VS Code. In VS Code, the user will run a new terminal. In the terminal, the user will change their working directory to the current directory. 

Run "npm install" to install the app.


## Usage 

Once installed, the user can run "node index.js" in their current directory. A series of prompts will run, and the user will answer these based on what they want in their readme. After answering all prompts, the user will see that a new file has been generated called "generatedReadme.md" which will contain the program-generated readme file.

Below is a image of how the page will look when the user is prompted. (Note: each question will display one at a time.)
